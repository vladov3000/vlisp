vlisp - Vlad's List Processor

  vlisp is an implementation of a tiny scheme-like programming language. It is
complete enough to run all the exercises in chapter one of "The Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs."

== Usage ==

  vlisp targets Linux, but will also likely work on MacOS. After confirming gcc
is installed, run "./build.sh". The resulting executable will be in
"build/vlisp".

  To evaluate all terms in a file, run "vlisp path/to/file".

== Limitations ==

  The implementation is a slow tree-walking interpreter. There is no garbage
collection; all terms are bump allocated on one memory arena until the end of
the program. There is also no real error handling, however there are "assert"s
to ensure no undefined behavior is encountered.
